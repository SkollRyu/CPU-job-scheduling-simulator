# CPU Scheduler
A discrete event simulator to conduct experiments on different processor loads 
and schedulers, and analyse the results to determine in which situations each 
scheduling algorithm works most efficiently.

## How to run it

## AIM
To investigate the performance of different CPU scheduling algorithms.
